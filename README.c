### Introduction
Welcome to the C Language repository! This README file serves as a guide to get you started with C programming and navigating through this repository.

### What is C Language?
C is a powerful general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s at Bell Labs. It is widely used for system and application software, developing operating systems, and embedded system programming. C is known for its efficiency, flexibility, and portability.

### Getting Started
If you're new to C programming, here are some steps to get started:

1. **Setting Up**: Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system. Popular compilers include GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), Clang, and Microsoft Visual C++.
   
2. **Learning Resources**: Familiarize yourself with the basics of C programming through tutorials, textbooks, or online courses. Some recommended resources include:
   - The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie
   - C Programming Tutorial on tutorialspoint.com
   - C Programming on Codecademy
   
3. **IDE or Text Editor**: Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a text editor for writing your C code. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom.

4. **Hello World**: Start with the classic "Hello, World!" program to ensure your setup is working correctly. Here's a simple example:
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   
   int main() {
       printf("Hello, World!\n");
       return 0;
   }
   ```
